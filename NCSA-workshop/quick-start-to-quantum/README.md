# Notebooks for the 2026 NCAS Workshop "A Quick Start to Accelerated Quantum Supercomputing"
These notebooks are intended for attendees of the 2026 NCSA Workshop "A Quick Start to Accelerated Quantum Supercomputing".  These notebooks are adapted from CUDA-Q Academic notebooks and are designed to give attendees an introduction necessary concepts in quantum computing and the bsics of programming in CUDA-Q. 

## Notebooks
The Jupyter notebooks in this folder are designed to run in an environment with CUDA-Q and Python.  For instructions on how to install CUDA-Q on your machine, check out this [guide](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/quick_start.html#install-cuda-q).  A Dockerfile and requirements.txt are also included in the main directory of the repository to help get you set up.

For system uniformity during the worksop we suggest that you run the notebooks using Google CoLab via the links below.

[^1]:You will need to run the command `!pip install cudaq` in a python code block in each notebook to run on Google CoLab.
