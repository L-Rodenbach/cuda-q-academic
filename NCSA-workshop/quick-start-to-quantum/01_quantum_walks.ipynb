    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical random walk can be viewed as a decision tree, as in the diagram below.  Here, a walker begins in the center of the line. After a coin flip, the walker moves to the left or right depending on the outcome of the coin flip (e.g., flipping heads will send the walker one step to the left, while flipping tails will send the walker one step to the right).  After $n$ coin flips, we record the position of the walker.  This experiment is repeated multiple times to generate a histogram of the walker's final position.\n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout this walk, the state of the walker changes according to quantum shift operators ($S_+, S_-$) which depend on the state of the coin $\\ket{\\psi_C}$. In particular, the $S_{-}$ operation checks if $\\ket{\\psi_C}$ in the state $\\ket{0}$ (i.e., heads) and if so, induces a shift left operation $DEC$ on the quantum walker. Similarly, $S_{+}$ is defined for tails and shifting right. At each time step, the state of the coin changes (i.e., is \"flipped\") via a quantum operation ($F$), which we'll call the coin-flip operator. Unlike the classical random walk, we will not know the position of the walker until the end of the process, when the quantum state of the walker is measured. \n",

In other words, the computational basis state $\\ket{\\bf{i}}$ represents the $i^{th}$ location on the line. \n",

For instance, if the walker began the experiment at position $0$, then the state of the walker at time $0$ would be $\\ket{\\psi_W(0)}=\\ket{0000}$.  \n",

    "* **If the coin qubit is in state $\\ket{0}$ (heads),** apply an operator (DEC) that shifts the walker one step to the left.\n",

Notice the control symbols on the coin's wire: the filled-in circle (⚫) is standard notation for a control on the $\\ket{1}$ state (triggering the INC operation), and the open circle  (⚪) is for a control on the $\\ket{0}$ state (triggering the DEC operation).\n",

This behavior might not be desired, for instance, in a financial application where the positions of the walker represent stock prices and movement is related to positive or negative investor sentiment. \n",
